How did I do on this assignment? I felt like I took off really strong. I had a good direction. I was successful at first. Once I got stuck I got really stuck. I was able to get over a few hurdles but at the end and of the day I couldn't get the problem that eluded me for so long (basically being able to force a key and date to combine for the offset. I feel like my testing was really good. I knew what I needed to do. I had direction on solving the problems but when I solved, and it did not work (endgame) I could not go back and solve it in a different, more dynamic, way. I think i would give myself a 2 overall.
